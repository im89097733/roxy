What I did for TriNimbus DB Infrastructure 
=============================================
1) Created a pulicly accessible RDS instance (roxyDB) in the TriNimbus account with a basic key, value  pair table called 'kv' in schema'sinmpleKV'
2) Created a user account trinimbus/trinimbus with access to simpleKV
3) Used MySQL Workbench to create the 'kv' table and populate it with some KV pairs


What I did in dev
====================
1) Using an existing Eclipse/Java/Tomcat local dev environemnt
2) Re-using a RESTTest.html javascript page that allows me to post JSON to a servlet (endpoint/API). Servlets coded in Java.
3) Added a DBAccess.java class to manage access to the RDS instance (MySQL JDBC connection)
4) Created a Query.java servlet that uses the DBAccess.java class (/query is the endpoint url)
8) Tested the /query endpoint using RESTTest.html from my local dev server against the RDS


What I did to get a base image
===================================
1) cloned an instance that I am using for another project
2) Used RDP to strip dowm the application components from Tomcat
3) added the driver for MySQL
4) added my 2 java classes and the RESTTest.html and the supporting javascript code (already existed on base image, I wrote this code a few years ago)
5) Added the public IP address of this prototype instance to the RDS sg inbound firewall
6) Tested the App /query endpoint using RESTTest.html.  All good.
7) Created AMI from this instance and made it public

What I did for TriNimbus App Container
===========================================
1) Created instance from public AMI
2) Opened access to RDS instance and onfirmed it still works against public RDS
3) Created base AMI for deployments
------------------------------------------------MONDAY------------------------------------------------------
4) Created VPC with 2 availability zones
5) Bound RDS to the VPC and closed firewall for only access from the VPC / SG for demo
6) confirmed App works from mulitiple zones when launched with SG
6) Created an 2 ASG for Target Group for 2 different AZs
7) Setup unsecured ELB with Target Group
8) Tested App from Web and it works
9) create a certificate for trinimbus.andress.ca and install on ELB for SSL
------------------ STUCK... seems to be permission issues for both creating ACM certificates and importing PEM ------------------------
10) Tested App from Web for HTTPS

------------------------------ THURSDAY --------------------------------------------
1) created git
2) writing readme.md
3) creating various deploy scripts
